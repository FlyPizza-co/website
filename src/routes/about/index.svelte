    <div class="mx-auto text-center max-w-6xl">
        <p class="text-2xl text-center my-8 ">We are (technically) the first Microsoft Flight Simulator virtual airline, with our roots tracing back to the beginning of 2020. Originally starting as a joke, pizza became a big deal in the official MSFS Discord server. As time went on, pizza became more serious. An exclusive invite-only discord server was created for active members of the so-called "pizza cult," with the intention of opening up the doors as a virtual airline a few weeks later. That never ended up happening. However, two years later, we are finally ready to open our doors to new members (not sure yet). </p>
